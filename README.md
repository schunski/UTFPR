# UTFPR Activities

## Overview

This project serves as a personal repository to document and showcase my academic progress at UTFPR (Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná). The primary goal is to archive my university assignments, track my learning journey, and demonstrate the skills and concepts I have developed throughout my academic experience.

Each activity in this repository represents a milestone in my programming education, showcasing practical applications of the theoretical knowledge gained during the course. This project is a living record of my growth as a programmer and a way to reflect on my development over time.

## Objectives

- **Track Progress**: Save and organize all programming assignments and activities completed during the course.
- **Showcase Skills**: Highlight the programming concepts, techniques, and tools learned and applied in a clear and structured manner.
- **Document Learning**: Provide context and explanations for each activity to demonstrate my understanding of the material.
- **Build a Portfolio**: Create a centralized collection of my work to share with peers, instructors, or potential employers.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized to make it easy to navigate and understand the progression of activities. The structure is as follows:

- `/activities-name`: Contains individual folders for each assignment or activity, labeled by topic or week (e.g., `activity-name1`, `activity-name2`).
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and its purpose.

Each activity folder typically includes:

- The source code for the assignment (e.g., `.html`, `.js`, or other relevant files).
- A brief description of the task and the concepts applied.
- Any additional resources, such as input/output examples or screenshots.

## Technologies Used

This project primarily focuses on the tools and languages. These may include:

- **Programming Languages**: HTML, Javascript, or others as required by the course.
- **Tools**: Git for version control, Visual Studio Code, and GitHub for hosting the repository.
- **Concepts Covered**: Variables, loops, conditionals, functions, data structures, file I/O, and more, depending on the curriculum.

## Getting Started

To clone and explore this repository locally, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/schunski/UTFPR.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd UTFPR

# Explore the activities
ls activities-name/
```

## Future Plans

As the course progresses, I plan to:

- Add more activities as they are completed.
- Improve documentation with detailed explanations of complex concepts.
- Refactor older code to reflect new knowledge and best practices.
- Potentially expand the repository to include projects from other courses or personal programming endeavors.
